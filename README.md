# ACCOL Syntax for Visual Studio Code

For the dozen or so people who want to edit `.acc` files in VSCode instead of ACCOL Workbench

## Installation

Open VS Code, then launch Quick Open (`Ctrl+P`). Paste in `ext install en-automationstevew.accol-syntax` and press enter.

Alternatively, clone this repository into your VS Code extensions folder ([Where is that?](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_where-are-extensions-installed)), then restart VS Code.

## Known Issues

 - Some variables that don't have separaters (e.g. `#OFF`) register as strings instead
